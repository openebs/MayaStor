# Quickstart Guide

### Has been relocated

As of release 0.4.0-alpha the Mayastor user's quickstart guide has moved.

It is now hosted at [GitBook](https://mayastor.gitbook.io/introduction/).

# Deployment Files

The files in this directory are provided as a convenience, a template for the successful test deployment of Mayastor to a cluster.

**NOTE:** ALL versions of deployment files from v0.4.0 specify the 'latest' tag on Mayastor container images.  If you wish to deploy earlier versions, your own builds, or a nightly build, you must change the image tags accordingly.
