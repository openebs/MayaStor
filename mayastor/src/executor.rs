//! Future executor and a couple of related utility functions.
//! The executor is started on current thread and saved to TLS.
//! It is a local single-threaded executor. It is fine to use it for
//! mgmt tasks but it should not be used for IO which should scale with
//! number of cpu cores.
//!
//! Any code wishing to spawn a future and runnig on the same thread
//! can obtain the spawner for executor in TLS and spawn it.

/// Everything we need to store to thread local storage (kinda global state) to
/// manage and dispatch tasks to executor.
///
/// More on how concurrent access to the context is guaranteed to be safe:
/// The context is stored in TLS and it is not sent between threads so the
/// concurrent access is not possible. Still we must prevent situations like:
///
/// fn A has mut ref of member 1, it calls fn B which obtains mut ref of
/// member 1 from TLS. Thus fn A has no way of knowing that the data it has
/// referenced might have been changed after fn B finished executing. Simply
/// put: mut-mut, mut-const combinations should be forbidden as always in Rust.
///
/// This can happen easily. If tick() which references executor, executes a
/// future and the future calls start, stop or spawn function. To prevent
/// getting into these unsafe situations, we have following basic rules:
///
///   1) no restrictions on start() as it is creating the context and
///      there can't be prior reference to the context.
///   2) after the executor is created the only place where mutable ref to the
///      executor may be obtained is the tick().
///   3) spawn() may only use pre-allocated spawner from the context structure.
///   4) stop() may only set shutdown_cb, but the actual release of
///      executor must be done inside the tick().
